## 🔧 What I Did Today

### ✅ Repository Setup
- I created the repository: `version-controlled-DevOps-project`
- Cloned it locally and initialized the project structure

### ✅ Branching Strategy
I created and worked with the following branches:
- `main` – production-ready branch  
- `dev` – base development branch  
- `feature-readme-update` – for updating the README.md file  
- `feature-doc-update` – for additional documentation edits  

### ✅ Files I Added and Updated
- `.gitignore` – added to exclude unnecessary files like `node_modules/`, `.env`, etc.  
- `README.md` – wrote detailed documentation of everything I did today  

### ✅ Git Workflow I Followed
- Used `git checkout -b` to create new branches  
- Made commits with proper messages  
- Pushed each branch to GitHub  
- Created Pull Requests from feature branches to `dev`  
- Deleted merged branches after completion  

### ✅ Pull Requests & Conflict Resolution
- Created pull requests from both `feature-readme-update` and `feature-doc-update` to `dev`  
- Resolved conflicts in the `README.md` file using the web editor and VS Code  
- Completed merges successfully after resolving all conflicts
